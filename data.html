    <p class="s10 c4">The idea of becoming a professional athlete and getting paid to play is very exciting. But the
        truth is, only a very small number of athletes make it to the pros. About 1 in 16,000 high school athletes
        becomes a professional athlete. Less than 1 out of every 100 high school athletes receive a scholarship of any
        kind to a Division I school. (US Dept. of Education)</p>

    <h3 class="s1">Lower Body Strength </h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">Lower body strength is necessary for nearly any athletic activity. In soccer, a great deal of
        power and torque for throwing and hitting comes from the hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteal muscles. Because

    <h3 class="s1">Upper Body Strength </h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">After the legs, the upper body is the next most important area for good soccer fitness. Upper body
        strength and mobility can help a soccer player throw a ball faster and further and also help reduce the
        likelihood of rotator cuff injuries. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s13 c6">Upper body strength is developed in two distinct ways: </p>

    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Push exercises,</span><span class="c2"> in which you are pushing something away from your body, are great for increasing strength and mobility in the chest and arms. Some of the best upper body exercises are body weight exercises like bent-arm hold pull-ups and pushups. Bear in mind that bigger is not necessarily better. In fact, bulky upper body muscles can actually decrease mobility. </span>

            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s overall fitness. At Level 2, a youth soccer player should be able to perform all Level 1 tests at a higher level in terms of time and distance. These exercises are revisited below, and several more exercises are introduced. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c26">NOTE: This section was written per Dave’s input and will need to be adapted for girls’ soccer. However, the word “baseball” has been replaced with “soccer” throughout the book.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Lower Body Strength </h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">As discussed in Level 1, lower body strength is necessary for nearly any athletic activity. In
        soccer, a great deal of power and torque for throwing and hitting comes from the hamstrings, quadriceps, and
        gluteal muscles. Because soccer players throw and swing with the same side of the body each time, soccer is a
        sport that tends to make athletes one-side dominant.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Exercises like </span><span class="c10">single-leg wall squats</span><span
            class="c2"> and </span><span class="c10">broad jumps</span><span class="c2"> can help a youth soccer player develop the leg strength, posture and mobility that lead to better soccer technique. Single-leg wall squats, </span><span
            class="c10">single-leg wall sits </span><span class="c2">and</span><span
            class="c10"> lateral jumps</span><span class="c2"> can also help determine if one leg is stronger than the other, and can be used to develop a better balance of strength in both legs. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s13 c6">To perform single-leg wall squats:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Stand on one leg while the other leg is lifted off the ground in front of the body. The hip should be bent to approximately 45 degrees and the knee bent to approximately 90 degrees. </span>

    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s14 s22 li1 b2"><span class="c14">Hold the arms out straight in front of you with the hands clasped together. From this position, squat down until the knee is bent to approximately 60 degrees.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s14 s22 li1 b2"><span class="c14">Return to the start position and repeat.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s13 c6">To perform a single-leg wall sit:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Stand with the back against a smooth vertical wall and feet approximately shoulder width apart. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Slowly slide the back down the wall until both knees and hips are at a 90-degree angle. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Lift one foot off the ground and hold it as long as possible. After a period of rest, lift the other foot and hold it. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">NOTE:</span><span class="c2"> If you can hold one foot up considerably longer than the other, you may need to work on developing a better balance of strength in both legs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s13 c6">To perform a broad jump:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">

    <h3 class="s1">Upper Body Strength</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">In Level 1, upper body strength was identified as the second most important element for good soccer fitness. Exercises that improve the strength and mobility of the upper body muscles help a soccer player throw a ball faster and further and also help to reduce the likelihood of rotator cuff injuries.</span><span
            class="c47"> </span></p>
    <p class="s9 s76"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">When a player throws a soccer ball, the throwing arm both accelerates and decelerates, or slows down. The </span><span
            class="c2">decelerator muscle groups </span><span class="c2">are like the brakes of a car; they </span><span
            class="c2">allow the fast-moving body parts to slow down.</span><span class="c2"> In soccer, strong back muscles are important for safe deceleration during throwing actions. The better your brakes, the more velocity can be gained without sacrificing health. This is especially important for pitchers, who throw the ball much more often than any other position player. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">As discussed in Level 1, </span><span class="c10">pull exercises</span><span

    <p class="s10 c4">All athletes need to drink water before, during and after practices and games. This is especially
        important on days when both temperatures and humidity levels are high. If a youth soccer player does not drink
        enough water, she could suffer from dehydration. </p>

    <h3 class="s1">Recovery</h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">Youth soccer players need to eat and drink within 30 minutes of a practice or game to make up for
        the calories they are burning and fluids they are using. Replenishing calories and fluids also aids in muscle
        recovery and repair. </p>

    <p class="s54 c23">Sleep</p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Just as increased activity creates a greater need for calories, it also creates a greater need for sleep. An athlete</span><span

    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level 2 youth athlete should get 10-11 hours of sleep each night for proper growth and development. If that</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s not possible, or if she needs additional recovery time, she should look at her weekly schedule and plan how she can incorporate additional sleep or rest time. To get the additional rest she needs, she can take short naps (no more than 30 minutes) or engage in quiet rest periods (lying down, reading or watching TV).</span>

    <h3 class="s1">Mentality</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Being a better athlete does not necessarily mean training harder or longer. Certainly a youth soccer player must spend time physically preparing her body to meet the demands of a practice session or game. Similarly, engaging in </span><span
            class="c10">Mental Preparation</span><span class="c2"> can help her perform at a higher level by creating the </span><span
            class="c2">proper mindset for either practice or a game.</span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">At Level 1, a </span><span class="c2">youth soccer player mentally prepares by closing her eyes, breathing deeply and envisioning herself having fun on the soccer field. This is also a great activity to practice a</span><span
            class="c2">t Level 2. In addition, a </span><span class="c2">youth soccer player </span><span class="c2">should </span><span
            class="c2">engage in activities that help her </span><span class="c2">build confidence in her own abilities and push herself to higher levels of performance. </span>

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">At Level 2, a youth soccer player should begin to take responsibility for keeping her equipment clean and well-maintained and for washing and folding her uniform properly. At this age she should also take responsibility for her personal hygiene by showering regularly and always wearing deodorant so she can arrive at practices and games well-groomed and ready to go to work.</span>

    </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 1, a youth soccer player begins to develop an understanding of what it takes to be an
        effective leader by watching how her coaches inspire and motivate her and her teammates. At Level 2, she can
        begin to display some of the leadership skills she has observed by looking out for and encouraging the less
        talented players on the team. For instance, she may invite a less talented player to work with her outside of a

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">As a youth soccer player moves into Level 2 during the middle school years, she should begin to

    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">As was discussed in Chapter 1 </span><span class="c2">– </span><span class="c2">Level 1, parents take on a fair amount of responsibility when their daughters begin to play soccer. Parents are responsible for getting them to practices and games, both on their own and by forming carpools with other families. They help their daughters obtain and pay for equipment, uniforms and more. And they often take time out of their busy schedules to attend games and cheer their daughters on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Youth soccer players who develop strong organizational skills tend to have stronger, more positive family relationships. For example, youth soccer players who keep track of practice and game schedules will know when their uniforms need to be clean, and won</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">t be asking mom or dad to wash their uniforms at the last minute. Youth soccer players who keep their equipment organized and in a safe place will always know right where to find everything they need for a practice or game. Also, being aware of any regularly scheduled activities of other family members helps the youth soccer player know when her parents are available for carpooling to special practices or other events.</span>

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s64"><span class="c12">Academics</span></h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">In addition to maintaining good grades and behaving appropriately in class, which was discussed at Level 1, a youth soccer player must remember that school is more important than sports. In fact, if a coach</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s decision comes down to two athletes with the same amount of athleticism, the coach will almost always choose the athlete with the better grades. In addition, higher academic achievement leads to acceptance into more colleges as well as more scholarship offers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Middle school is obviously tougher than elementary school; nonetheless, grades must be maintained.
        Staying organized can go a long way toward helping a youth soccer player balance school and sports. </p>

    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">One last note:</span><span class="c2"> Some youth soccer players consider transferring to a different high school than they</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span
            class="c2">re supposed to go to in order to play for a certain coach. It</span><span

    <h3 class="s64"><span class="c12">Social Life</span></h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">While many youth soccer players</span><span class="c2">’ </span><span class="c2">social lives revolve around their teammates, many have friends outside of sports. Either way, a youth soccer player should develop a </span><span
            class="c10">Lifestyle</span><span class="c2"> that includes spending time with friends outside of the field of play</span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2">AND offline.</span></p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">As was discussed in Level 1, a solid </span><span class="c10">Social Life</span><span
            class="c2"> is important for all young people, not just youth athletes. Friends provide companionship and recreation. Friends also give advice to one another and often help to ease anxiety during times of stress. Young people who don</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">t have friends tend to be more lonely and unhappy, have lower levels of academic achievement and lower self-esteem. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Spending time socializing online has become the norm for many young people. However, it</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span
            class="c2">s important for young people to remember that their online life isn</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">t a substitute for spending time with friends face to face. In-person socializing provides more of the benefits of friendship and also helps youth athletes develop better interpersonal skills, which are essential for success in all areas of life.</span>

            class="c2"> </span><span class="c10">social interactions</span></p>
    <p class="s10 c4">If you think you type more than you speak to your friends, you may need to find a healthier
        balance between online and in-person interactions. One way is to measure the amount of time you spend online and
        compare it to the amount of time you spend with your friends in person. </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Challenge yourself to make your in-person time higher than your online time.</p>

    <h3 class="s1">Role Model</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">At Level 1, a </span><span class="c10">Role Model</span><span class="c2"> was defined as someone who possesses qualities that others admire, such as demonstrating respect for themselves and others. At Level 2 being a good role model revolves around modeling good behavior in school as well as on and off the field of play.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Good behavior starts with knowing the rules. In school, the rules usually include sitting still at your desk, listening to your teacher and raising your hand if you want to speak. Other schools may have other rules, but generally speaking, knowing</span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2">and obeying</span><span class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2">those rules automatically leads to good behavior. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">On the field of play, good behavior starts with listening to your coaches, doing what they tell you to do and not whining when things don</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">t go your way. The best way to model good behavior on the field is to treat others the same way you would want them to treat you.</span>

            class="c2">At Level 1, youth soccer players demonstrate this attribute by playing simply for the love of the game. At Level 2, youth soccer players who live for the sport spend more time practicing drills and mastering skills. These are the girls who are often seen dribbling a ball wherever and whenever they can. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">They also begin to spend time watching professional women</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s soccer matches live or on television to learn more about the game and to see how the pros do it. Youth soccer players who live for the sport also start to spend more time learning and understanding ALL the rules of the game.</span>

    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">In just about any sport, the basic techniques are the most important skills to master. These skills are the building blocks upon which more advanced skills are learned. Although you might have started to specialize in a specific position at Level 2, at Level 3 you will spend the majority of your private practice time in the position you (or your coaches) feel you will play at the next level. If you</span><span

    <h2 class="s53">Level 3 Fitness </h2>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Fitness matters.</span><span class="c2"> Strength and speed are required to play the game of soccer effectively. Flexibility and mobility help to prevent injuries. As a youth soccer player reaches Level 3, she can separate herself from other players by demonstrating a serious dedication to her own personal fitness. Not only does this help to establish a foundation of strength; it also teaches good habits needed for success in higher levels of soccer. After all, the demands of training at the college and pro levels can be mentally and physically challenging especially for those athletes who are not already used to working that hard at lower levels of the sport. </span>

    <h3 class="s1">Lower Body Strength</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">As discussed in Level 1, a great deal of power and torque for throwing and hitting comes from the hamstrings, quadriceps, and gluteal muscles. Exercises like </span><span

            class="c10">triple broad jumps</span><span class="c2"> can help a youth soccer player develop the leg strength, posture and mobility that lead to better soccer technique. Single-leg wall squats, </span><span
            class="c10">single-leg wall sits </span><span class="c2">and</span><span
            class="c10"> lateral jumps</span><span class="c2"> can also help determine if one leg is stronger than the other, and can be used to develop a better balance of strength in both legs. </span>

    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Preparation</span><span class="c2"> refers to off-the-field activities, such as practicing skills, eating right, staying hydrated, getting enough rest and mentally preparing for a game or practice. Coaches love athletes who prepare: these are the players who are eager to learn, eager to play and, ultimately, eager to win.

    <h3 class="s1">Practice</h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">A youth athlete who has surpassed Level 2 obviously considers soccer a huge part of her life. By
        this point, she should have already begun to work with a private soccer coach to master the basic techniques and
        to begin to learn a few position-specific skills. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 3, a youth athlete should begin to identify those positions at which she is most
        proficient. Both her team soccer coaches as well as her private coach can help her decide which positions make
        the most sense for her. In addition to team practices and one-on-one sessions with her private coach, the youth
        soccer player can continue her regular individual practice sessions, focusing extra attention on the skills
        needed for the positions she wants to play.</p>

A high-school-aged athlete may still be going through a growth spurt; therefore sleep is crucial for proper growth and development. According to the National Sleep Foundation, a Level 3 youth athlete should get 8-10 hours of sleep each night for proper growth and development. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">A lot of youth soccer players stress out about the amount of sleep they may be getting, especially the night before a big game. It</span><span

Instead, consider the most important night of sleep to be two days before game day, and the second most important night of sleep to be three days before game day. Make sure you get the sleep you need on those nights, and try to rest up before the actual game on game day.</span>

    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">Showing </span><span class="c10">Respect</span><span class="c2"> means treating others in ways that show they have worth and value, and being considerate of other people</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s feelings. Levels 1 and 2 discussed treating coaches and players with respect. At Level 3, a youth soccer player should work on treating herself with respect. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">One of the most important ways to show yourself respect is by forgiving yourself if you make a mistake in the game. Mistakes happen to everyone. The time you spend dwelling on them is time and concentration you</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">re taking away from other areas of your life. Get over it and get right back into the game. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Respecting yourself also means taking good care of yourself physically. As a youth athlete, you
        need to carefully nourish and hydrate your body according to the guidelines provided in this manual, not only
        for optimal performance on the field of play, but also for optimal health and well-being. In addition you must
        not be tempted to use performance-enhancing drugs, consume alcohol or other illegal substances.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Sportsmanship</h3>

    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Accountability means taking responsibility for one</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s own mistakes. In other words, if you make a mistake or bad play, you accept it, you do not make excuses for why it happened and you do not blame others for it. In addition, when you know you</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">ve made a mistake, you accept the ruling on the field and do not argue with coaches or officials.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Teamwork</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Teamwork</span><span class="c2"> means working together as a group in order to achieve a goal. In sports, players contribute their individual skills and efforts in cooperation with their teammates to win games. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">By Level 3, a youth soccer player is entering high school, and the pressure may be on to maximize her playing time in order to impress college recruiters. However, a soccer player who focuses more on her own individual performance instead of the team’s performance will probably not impress very many recruiters. </span>

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Professionalism</h3>

    </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 2, a youth soccer player begins to take responsibility for keeping her uniform and
        equipment clean and well-maintained, for maintaining her personal hygiene and for arriving at practices and
        games well-groomed and ready to go to work. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 3, this responsibility takes on even more importance as college recruiters visit her high
        school to watch her team play. Players who display a professional appearance and demeanor will definitely make a
        good impression on recruiters.</p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Leadership</h3>
    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">A </span><span class="c10">good leader</span><span class="c2"> is able to inspire and motivate others to do something that they would not normally do, or to perform better than they would on their own. A youth soccer player can sometimes motivate and inspire her fellow players in ways that coaches cannot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">As a youth soccer player enters high school at Level 3, she should continue to develop her leadership skills through her interactions with teammates. In fact, she may decide she</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s ready to take her leadership skills to the next level by becoming a team leader. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">A team leader needs to have the trust and respect of her teammates in order to be effective. One way to earn that trust and respect would be to </span><span
            class="c2">encourage other players to </span><span class="c2">come to her with questions, to bounce ideas off her, or even to complain. As her teammates’ confidence in her grows, she can help strengthen the team through team-building and problem-solving activities.</span>

Creating a healthy balance between sports, academics, family obligations and social activities requires strong time management skills and a clear understanding of what</span><span

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">As a youth soccer player moves into Level 3 during the high school years, the way she balances those elements in her life will shift as she and her family begin to focus on getting into college and earning scholarships.</span>

    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 4, a soccer player is at the college level. She likely has a strength-and-conditioning
        coach who supervises fitness workouts. However, because that coach is working with an entire team of soccer
        players, he or she will be limited in terms of the time spent with each individual athlete. In addition, at NCAA
        colleges and universities, rules are in place to limit the amount of practice and conditioning time required by
        and supervised by the coaches. </p>

    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 4, a youth soccer player becomes a college-level student-athlete. By achieving Level 4, a
        student-athlete has consistently demonstrated respect for her coaches and game officials, her teammates and
        opponents, as well as herself. These skills will likely be tested while she is in college.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s9"><span
            class="c2">At college, a student-athlete is under a great deal of pressure to perform</span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2">both on the field as well as in the classroom. There are also many more temptations to engage in activities that do not contribute to her health and well-being, such as drinking alcohol or taking performance-enhancing drugs or other illegal substances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 4, a student-athlete should always demonstrate respect for the game of soccer. Taking
        performance-enhancing drugs violates the rules as well as the integrity with which you play, and should be
        avoided at all times.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Sportsmanship</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Good Sportsmanship</span><span class="c2"> starts with respect for one</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s teammates, opponents, coaches, and officials. It also includes maintaining a positive attitude when dealing with adversity </span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2"> or victory. </span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">At Level 4, the stakes are higher and the pressure to win is greater. Student-athletes often play with a great deal of emotion, putting everything they</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span
            class="c2">ve got into the game. Some find it difficult to contain their emotions </span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2"> before, during and at the end of the game. </span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">A LEVEL 4 COMPLETE ATHLETE demonstrates good sportsmanship by:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s86 s87 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Not trash talking the other team or players online or off before the game.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s86 s87 li1 b1"><span
                class="c1">Graciously shaking hands with opponents before and after each game.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s86 s87 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Not gloating if her team wins.</span></li>

        <li class="s86 s87 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Sincerely congratulating the other team if her team loses.</span>

    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Teamwork</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c10">Teamwork</span><span class="c2"> means working together as a group in order to achieve a goal. In sports, players contribute their individual skills and efforts in cooperation with their teammates to win games. Learning to play as part of a team, and not just as an individual athlete, is important at every level of play.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">By Level 4, a youth soccer player has dedicated a great deal of her time and energy to get to this
        point, and she has a right to be proud of her accomplishment. So do her teammates.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">At this stage, each member of the team has reached an elite level of play. Soccer is no longer
        just a game; your team might be playing for a championship at some point. Teammates need to commit to each other
        to the point of feeling like they are part of a family all working toward a common goal.</p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">It almost feels like an earlier level at which the members of the team need to learn to trust each
        other in order to work together as an effective team. Teambuilding exercises should be taken very seriously, and
        any personality issues must be worked out immediately. </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Professionalism</h3>
    <p class="s9"><span class="c2">As a youth soccer player becomes a student-athlete, professionalism takes on a new meaning. She now plays for a college team, and she needs to represent that team with dignity and pride</span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2"> both on and off the field, as well as on- and offline. Not doing so can have serious consequences in terms of any scholarships she may have received.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4"> A student-athlete should always maintain professionalism in terms of her appearance, her attitude
        and her actions. Some examples include:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Learning rules of etiquette and always displaying good manners.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Dressing appropriately off the field </span><span
                class="c32">⎯</span><span class="c1"> no obscene T-shirts, no skimpy clothing, etc.  </span></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Wearing team apparel that represents her college or university, not another one.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Keeping her online presence uncontroversial.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Staying away from inappropriate situations, such as parties where drugs may be present.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Avoiding the bar scene, especially if she is underage.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Leadership</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">A youth soccer player may have become a team leader in high school. As she moves on to college play, she may continue in that role. </span><span
            class="c2">A leader for a college-level team must be able to:</span></p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">

    <h2 class="s53">Level 4 Lifestyle</h2>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">A Level 4 soccer player has achieved a great feat: Playing at the college level. Chances are, she has earned an athletic scholarship, an academic scholarship or both. As a college-level student athlete, she will need to employ all of the time management and organization skills learned throughout this journey in order to maintain a satisfactory balance between sports, academics, family obligations and social activities.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Family</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">A soccer player who has achieved Level 4 COMPLETE ATHLETE status has already laid the foundation for a lifelong positive relationship with her family. While at college, she should strive to maintain those positive relationships by: </span>
    </p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Keeping in touch.</span><span class="c1"> Set aside a specific day and time each week to talk to your family by phone. You can also communicate regularly via email or text messaging. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Staying in the loop.</span><span

        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Visit face to face.</span><span class="c1"> Discuss with your family options for spending time together face to face during holidays, birthdays or other special events. Be actively involved in the planning so that you can work around important sports and/or academic responsibilities. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Academics</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Many student athletes assume they</span><span class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">ll go on to play their sport professionally after college</span><span
            class="c7">⎯</span><span class="c2">or even before graduating. The truth is, there are more than 460,000 NCAA student-athletes, and fewer than two percent will go pro in their sports.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">The experiences of college athletics and the life lessons student-athletes learn along the way
        will help them as they pursue a career in any field. Student-athletes should take advantage of every resource
        and opportunity available to them at the college or university they attend. In fact, many NCAA colleges and
        universities provide special resources to their student-athletes, including:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Academic tutors </span><span class="c1">for both group and individualized tutoring</span>

    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Academic centers </span><span class="c1">that include</span><span
                class="c39"> </span><span class="c1">tutoring space, individual and group study spaces, computer labs and more </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Individualized academic counseling </span><span class="c1">to help student-athletes develop a plan for successfully managing their academic pursuits and reaching their academic goals</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Career development resources </span><span
                class="c1">including</span><span class="c39"> </span><span class="c1">career placement services for summer internships and job opportunities, r</span><span

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s56"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Whether or not a student-athlete intends to go on to pursue soccer at the professional level, she
        should absolutely maintain her grades throughout college and graduate with a degree in a marketable field. After
        all, even a professional sports career will not last forever, and a college graduate will have more
        opportunities available than one who has not earned a degree. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s20"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Social Life &amp; Role Model </h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">At Level 3, soccer players learned how to recognize and value a true friend and be a good role model to others. These attributes are also important at Level 4. With all the pressures on student-athletes, having strong friendships is vital to their emotional health. True friends will listen and sympathize when that</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span
            class="c2">s needed, and they will provide fun and companionship when that</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s needed. Once again, it</span><span class="c2">’</span><span
            class="c2">s important to be considerate of friends</span><span class="c2">’ </span><span class="c2">time and other commitments, and to be responsible when it comes to one</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s own commitments. Nonetheless, carving out time for friends is an important part of a balanced lifestyle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">When it comes to socializing at college, the temptations to behave badly are many, and the
        consequences can be dire. There are parties at which alcohol may be served. Illegal drugs and other substances
        are often readily available on college campuses. Stressed out friends may engage in impulsive, dangerous
        behavior, and insist that you join them. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Student-athletes can be kicked off the team and lose their scholarships for many reasons. Their best bet is to continue to be a good role model by avoiding social situations that can get them into trouble. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <h3 class="s1">Living Your Sport</h3>
    <p class="s10 c4">At Level 3, youth players who live the sport of soccer begin studying professional players,
        especially those that play the positions they want to play. This activity will continue at Level 4, as the
        student-athlete becomes even more of a student of the game and an enthusiastic fan. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">One professional recruiter told the story of a student-athlete who, when asked about her favorite
        player, talked about a lesser-known player in glowing terms. The recruiter immediately recognized someone who
        was a true student of the game.</p>

She knows her body well enough to know how to push herself while at the same time minimizing the risk of injury. After all, an injured player can</span><span

        <li class="s15 li1 b1"><span class="c1">Are you productive, healthy and happy on seven hours of sleep? Or do you need closer to nine hours of quality sleep time to feel this way? </span>

    <h3 class="s1">Mentality</h3>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Being a better athlete does not necessarily mean training harder or longer. Certainly a youth soccer player must spend time physically preparing her body to meet the demands of a practice session or game. Similarly, engaging in </span><span
            class="c10">Mental Preparation</span><span class="c2"> can help her perform at a higher level by creating the </span><span
            class="c2">proper mindset for either practice or a game.</span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">At Level 5, focus remains an important part of mental preparedness. More and more elite athletes and sports programs are incorporating mindfulness, meditation and other practices into their training regimen. According to Dr. Kristen Race, Ph.D., an expert on brain-based mindfulness solutions, </span><span
            class="c2">“</span><span class="c2">Mindfulness helps train the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that creates a calm and alert state of mind, which helps us stay focused, avoid distraction and perform at our best.</span><span
            class="c2">”</span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Practicing mindfulness is not easy, but like everything else in sports, the more you do it, the
        better you get at it. Dr. Race suggests the following tips for practicing mindfulness:</p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">
        <li class="s11 s12 li1 b1"><span class="c39">Engage in mindful breathing </span><span class="c1">every morning as well as before a game or practice to create a calm and clear state of mind. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and start to deepen your breath. Inhale fully and exhale completely. Focus on your breath entering and exiting your body. Start with five minutes and build up from there. </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="s9 s56"> </p>
    <ol style="padding:0 0 0 1px; margin:0%;">

                class="c39"> </span><span class="c1">release tension, quiet the mind and bring awareness to your body in a systematic way. Lie down on your back with your palms facing up and legs relaxed. Close your eyes. Start with your toes and notice how they feel. Are they tense? Are they warm or cold? Focus your attention here for a few breaths before moving on to the sole of your foot. Repeat the process as you travel from your foot to your ankle, calf, knee and thigh. Bring your attention to your right foot and repeat the process. <br/><br/>Continue to move up your hips, lower back, stomach, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, neck and head — maintaining your focus on each body part and any sensations there. Breathe into any areas that are holding stress and try to release it. </span>

    <p class="s10"> </p>

    <p class="s9 s21"> </p>
    <p class="s13 c6">History of Soccer</p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Soccer has a very interesting history. Believe it or not, there is evidence that a game similar to
        soccer was played in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC! Ancient Roman and Greek warriors also played a
        form of soccer to help them prepare for battle. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">During the 700s, the first soccer games were played in Britain. These games were very violent.
        Injury and even death occurred in nearly every game. For this reason, soccer was banned in England by King
        Edward in 1365. Anyone who was caught playing soccer was thrown into prison. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">Soccer was banned by many other kings and queens of England that came after King Edward. However, this did not stop people from playing the game. For many centuries, there</span><span
            class="c2"> were no universally accepted rules for </span><span class="c2">soccer. Different forms of the game were played in different areas of Great Britain</span><span
            class="c2">. </span></p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s10 c4">Soccer Rules Established</p>
    <p class="s10 c4">In 1963, the first-ever association for soccer was founded in England. It was called the Football
        Association, or FA, because in Europe, soccer is called football. Representatives from schools and clubs around
        Great Britain got together and established the first set of common rules for soccer matches. </p>

    <p class="s10 c4">Now that soccer had a standard set of rules, other European countries began to play the game. Many
        club teams were formed during the late 1800s and early 1900s in countries like Denmark, Netherlands, New
        Zealand, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Switzerland, Italy, Uruguay, Germany, Hungary and Finland. </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">In May 1904 in Paris, France, the governing body for worldwide soccer was established. It was named t</span><span
            class="c2">he </span><span class="c33">Fédération Internationale de Football Association,</span><span
            class="c2"> or </span><span class="c2">FIFA (FEE-fah) </span><span class="c2">for short. In English, it means the International Federation of Association Football.  FIFA is responsible for overseeing international competitions. FIFA also organizes the World Cup and the Women&apos;s World Cup.</span>

    <p class="s13 c6">Women in Soccer</p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">How long have women been playing soccer? Well, evidence shows that women played in the violent soccer games of old England! However, the Football Association</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s rules of 1863 established that the game was only for men to play. Nonetheless, women in England and Scotland played in informal soccer matches through the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">In Europe, women</span><span class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s soccer leagues began around 1930, and international competitions started in the 1950s. In the United States, women</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s soccer was confined to gym class, informal pickup games and college intramural competition until around the 1970s. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">By 1981, there were almost 100 varsity programs established in NCAA women</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s soccer, and even more club teams. By 2001 Division 1 women</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s college soccer tournaments started with 64 teams, compared to only 32 teams for the men. Teams at North Carolina Connecticut, Notre Dame, UCLA and Penn State became regular contenders for the national title. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">After college, some of the women on the college teams became professional soccer players. They joined the </span><span
            class="c2">United States women’s national football team (USWNT). USWNT represents the United States of America in international soccer competitions. </span><span

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span
            class="c2">Today, the United States is considered the top country in the world for women</span><span
            class="c2">’</span><span class="c2">s soccer, both in terms of participation and in international competition. Women soccer teams have won two World Cup titles and many gold and silver medals in the Olympics. </span>

    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span class="c2">For example, studies shown that an athlete who consumes a </span><span
            class="c2">“</span><span class="c2">bottom heavy</span><span class="c2">” </span><span class="c2">diet will have a higher body fat % than another athlete who consumes his meals throughout the day every 3-4 hours (even if both athletes are consuming the same total calories and following the same training regimen). You need to eat to fuel your body when your body needs the energy for optimal metabolism, lean muscle gain and to optimize performance. You may be skilled in the sport of soccer, but I promise you that mastering your nutrition will help take you to the next level! </span>
    </p>
    <p class="s10"> </p>
    <p class="s2"><span
            class="c72">Avoid packaged, processed and refined foods that are high in sugar or trans fat.</span><span
